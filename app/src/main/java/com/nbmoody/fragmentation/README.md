# Fragmentation

#### The overall goal of this app is to create a simple starting point for basic app-development.

This "app" is truly just a template I'm developing to use when implementing the Adnroid Navigation API with several different Fragments, for the sake of speeding up development. It includes a Main Activity with the NavHost, three Fragments, a Navigation Graph with all the Fragments as Destinations, Actions targeted by a NavController, and some animations for dressing-up the transitions. I'll use simple buttons to navigate through the app along the graph, and will setup logging with Timber to make it easier to figure how when which parts of the code are being called.
